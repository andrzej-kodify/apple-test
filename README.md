Repository for Apple.com macbook purchase process tests

The whole thing is flakey and far from being complete solution. I tried to fit in the time limit but there's a strong temptation to build a full blown test suite, so this is a mixup which never turns out well :)

TODO:
* Run headless and parallel, but for some reason only first test passes then
* Nice logger like winston or something
* ESLint, sonar or something
* Github actions workflow for pull requests
