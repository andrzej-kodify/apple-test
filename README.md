Repository for Apple.com macbook purchase process tests

The whole thing is flakey and far from being complete solution. I tried to fit in the time limit but there's a strong temptation to build a full blown test suite, so this is a mixup which never turns out well :)

```
# install deps
npm ci 
# run tests
npm test
# run tests in debug
npm run test:debug
```

TODO:
* Nice readme
* Nice logger like winston or something
* sonar or something
